# Holiday definitions

## 9/15/2016

Initial creation of this repository

This contains all of the definitions currently in the holidays repository but split out into its own repository. It will
be added as a submodule of the ruby repository, which will be responsible for generating its final classes.

The idea is that we will have repositories for multiple languages and each language is responsible for using the definitions
as it sees fit.
